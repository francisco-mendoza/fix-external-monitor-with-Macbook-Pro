## Fix External Monitor Color Problem with MacBookPro
Based on https://embdev.net/topic/284710#3027030
# Instructions
```
-   Download patch.rb and run ./patch.rb 

-   Take a look at the generated file and remember its path (mine was ~/Desktop/DisplayVendorID-10ac/DisplayProductID-4080 ).

-   Reboot into recovery mode (âŒ˜-R at boot).

-   Mount your main disk (enter Disk Utility, select the gray Macintosh HD, click Mount, provide your password, close Disk Utility).

-   Open up a terminal (Utilities -> Terminal), backup the overrides directory, copy in your new override file, and reboot:

```
````
$ cd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources
$ cp -R Overrides Overrides.bak
$ cp -R /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/jrr/Desktop/DisplayVendorID-10ac Overrides/
$ reboot
````

UPDATE
Connect only the problem display.

Create this directory structure (if it doesn't already exist):
````
sudo mkdir -p /Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
````
Download this ruby script in that directory:
````
cd /Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
sudo curl -O https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ejdyksen/8302862/raw/patch-edid.rb
````
Note: You may want to use adaugherity's version of the script instead.

Run the script we just downloaded (as root again). This creates a new display override plist file.
````
cd /Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides
````
````
sudo ruby patch-edid.rb
````
Unplug and replug in the problem display.
